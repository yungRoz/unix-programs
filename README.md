# UNIX Programs

A bunch of cool programs I wrote for a course dealing with OS utilities, creating and managing multiple processes, inter-process communication, and networking via UNIX.  

## Brief Overview of Each


### Adventure

A game written in C! One of the programs generates a bunch of room files containing information about possible connections to other rooms. The other program enables a player to navigate via the information in the files and try to find the "END" room. Super fun! :)

### One-Time Pads

Five small programs that utilize multi-processing and socket-based inter-process communication to encrypt and decrypt a message via One-Time Pad derived process.

### Smallsh

A shell program written in C

### Stats

A shell script that calculates mean and medians of numbers that can be input to the script from either a file or via stdin.
